# Jamming

This project is my attempt to learn and use APIs with React, as a part of the Codecademy Full Stack Development course. This app will use the Spotift API and have the following features:

- Search for songs by song title, artist and genre.

- Users can see information about each song like artist, genre.

- User can export their custom playlist to their personal SPotify account.
